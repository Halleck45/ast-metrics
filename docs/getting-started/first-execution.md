# Running AST Metrics for the first time

> If you haven't installed AST Metrics yet, please refer to the [installation guide](./install.md).

Locate the directory where your source code is stored. For example, if you have a project in the `/var/www/my-project` 
directory, you can run AST Metrics with the following command in your terminal:

```bash
ast-metrics /var/www/my-project
```

This will display the CLI application, which will analyze the source code in the specified directory.
