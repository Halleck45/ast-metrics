# AST Metrics

## What is static analysis with AST Metrics?

**Static analysis consists of analyzing the source code of a program without executing it**. AST Metrics uses the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to analyze the structure of the code. The AST is a tree representation of the source code that allows us to analyze the code in a structured way.

AST Metrics is a language-agnostic static code analyzer. It helps you to identify potential issues, and to find candidates for refactoring.

AST Metrics can generate HTML reports:
