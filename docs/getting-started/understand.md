## Understanding AST Metrics

You don't need a PhD in Computer Science to use AST Metrics, but understanding a few concepts will help you get the most out of it.

### 1. Everything is a Tree (AST)
First, you need to understand that any source code can be represented as a tree. This tree is called an [Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree).

For example, this code:

```python
while b ≠ 0:
    if a > b:
        a := a - b
    else:
        b := b - a
return a
```

Can be represented as this tree:

**AST Metrics analyzes this tree** to calculate complexity, volume, and other code-level metrics.

### 2. The Architecture is a Graph
Just like code forms a tree, **dependencies between your files form a graph**.

- When Class A uses Class B, there is a link.
- When Class B uses Class C, the chain continues.

AST Metrics analyzes this graph to find:

- **Communities**: Groups of classes that work together.
- **Cycles**: Circular dependencies that lock your system.
- **Coupling**: How tightly connected your components are.

### 3. From Math to Insights
By combining the AST analysis (micro-view) and the Graph analysis (macro-view), AST Metrics uses mathematical models to uncover hidden truths about your project:

- **Bus Factor**: Who is indispensable?
- **Risk**: Where are bugs likely to hide?
- **Architecture Violations**: Where is the code not doing what you think it is?
