# Rulesets & Linting

AST Metrics allows you to enforce rules on your codebase (Linting). You can check complexity, coupling, volume, and more.

## Managing Rulesets (CLI)

The easiest way to add rules is to use the `ruleset` command. It allows you to import pre-defined sets of rules.

### Available Rulesets

You can list available rulesets with:

```bash
ast-metrics ruleset list
```

| Ruleset | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **architecture** | Architecture-related constraints (e.g., coupling) |
| **volume** | Volume metrics (e.g., lines of code) |
| **complexity** | Complexity metrics (e.g., cyclomatic complexity) |
| **golang** | Golang-specific best practices and API hygiene |

### Installing a Ruleset

To add a ruleset to your configuration:

```bash
ast-metrics ruleset add architecture
ast-metrics ruleset add volume
```

### Detailed Rules

#### 🏗️ Architecture Ruleset
`ast-metrics ruleset add architecture`

| Rule Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **coupling** | Checks for forbidden coupling between packages |
| **max_afferent_coupling** | Checks the afferent coupling of files/classes |
| **max_efferent_coupling** | Checks the efferent coupling of files/classes |
| **min_maintainability** | Checks the maintainability of the code |
| **no_circular_dependencies** | Detect circular dependencies between classes |
| **max_responsibilities** | Maximum number of responsibilities (LCOM) per class |
| **no_god_class** | Avoid God Classes (too many methods/properties) |

#### 📏 Volume Ruleset
`ast-metrics ruleset add volume`

| Rule Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **max_loc** | Checks the lines of code in a file |
| **max_logical_loc** | Checks the logical lines of code in a file |
| **max_loc_by_method** | Checks the lines of code by method/function |
| **max_logical_loc_by_method** | Checks the logical lines of code by method/function |
| **max_methods_per_class** | Maximum number of methods per class |
| **max_switch_cases** | Maximum number of cases in switch statements |
| **max_parameters_per_method** | Maximum number of parameters per method |
| **max_nested_blocks** | Maximum nesting depth of blocks |
| **max_public_methods** | Maximum number of public methods per class |

#### 🧠 Complexity Ruleset
`ast-metrics ruleset add complexity`

| Rule Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **max_cyclomatic** | Checks the cyclomatic complexity of functions |

#### 🐹 Golang Ruleset
`ast-metrics ruleset add golang`

| Rule Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **no_package_name_in_method** | Do not include the package name in exported function or method identifiers |
| **max_nesting** | Limit nested depth of control structures (if/for/switch) |
| **max_file_size** | Limit file size (LOC) |
| **max_files_per_package** | Limit number of source files per package (excluding doc.go) |
| **slice_prealloc** | Check if slice preallocation is used |
| **context_missing** | Check if context is missing in function arguments |
| **context_ignored** | Check if context is ignored |

## Manual Configuration

You can also manually edit the `.ast-metrics.yaml` file at the root of your project.

```yaml
sources:
  - ./internal
exclude: []
reports:
  html: ./build/report
  markdown: ./build/report.md
requirements:
  rules:
    architecture:
      coupling:
        forbidden:
          - from: Controller
            to: Repository
          - from: Repository
            to: Service
      max_afferent_coupling: 10
      max_efferent_coupling: 10
      min_maintainability: 70
    volume:
      max_loc: 1000
      max_logical_loc: 600
      max_loc_by_method: 30
      max_logical_loc_by_method: 20
    complexity:
      max_cyclomatic: 10
    golang:
      no_package_name_in_method: true
      max_nesting: 4
      max_file_size: 1000
      max_files_per_package: 50
      slice_prealloc: true
      context_missing: true
      context_ignored: true
```

Run the analysis with:

```bash
ast-metrics analyze
```
