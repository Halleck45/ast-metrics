## Why?

Static code analysis is a game-changer for improving code quality. It helps you catch potential issues early, enforce coding standards, and gain deeper insights into your codebase.

With **AST Metrics**, you can:

- **Get a bird's-eye view of your project**: Quickly identify overly complex code or tightly coupled classes that could slow down your development or introduce bugs.  
- **Enforce architectural coherence**: Ensure your code structure aligns with best practicesâ€”for instance, making sure your service layer doesnâ€™t depend on your data access layer.

Whether you're maintaining an existing codebase or building a new one, AST Metrics empowers you to write better, more maintainable code.

## Features

+ **Designed for CI/CD**. You can integrate it into your pipeline to check that your code meets your quality standards, You can integrate it into your CI pipelines, whether you're using [GitHub Actions](https://halleck45.github.io/ast-metrics/ci/github-actions/) or [GitLab CI](https://halleck45.github.io/ast-metrics/ci/gitlab-ci/).
